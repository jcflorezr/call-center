# Call Center

* Dummy Object Oriented Programming project for simulating a call center module, where there is a chain of responsibility composed by 
hierarchy levels of employees that will answer the "incoming calls". 
* If there are no available employees, an unavailability notification will be sent to the dispatcher and the calls will be queued.
* Once an employee is available again an availability notification will be sent to the dispatcher an it will dispatch a previously
enqueued call.

## RELEASE 0.1

### Description
In this release the project is implemented with the Java SE platform only. 
#### The inversion of control is implemented through:
* The strategy pattern provided by the family of classes created implementing the Abstract Factory pattern inside the 
[net.learningpath.callcenter.employee](https://github.com/jcflorezr/call-center/tree/release-0.1/src/main/java/net/learningpath/callcenter/employee)
module.
* The freedom of choice how the chain of responsibility will be composed from the client side (look the [DispatcherImpl](https://github.com/jcflorezr/call-center/blob/release-0.1/src/main/java/net/learningpath/callcenter/service/DispatcherImpl.java)
class constructor).
#### In order to make a concurrent call center module capable of attending multiple calls in parallel:
* It was created a topic ([EmployeesAvailability](https://github.com/jcflorezr/call-center/blob/release-0.1/src/main/java/net/learningpath/callcenter/event/topic/EmployeesAvailability.java))
which is in charge to notify the suscribers ([DispatcherImpl](https://github.com/jcflorezr/call-center/blob/release-0.1/src/main/java/net/learningpath/callcenter/service/DispatcherImpl.java))
for both availability and unavailability of employees to attend the calls.
